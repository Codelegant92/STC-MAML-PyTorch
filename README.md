# STC-MAML-PyTorch
## A PyTorch Implementation of an Extended MAML Algorithm for Few-Shot Spoken Term Classification
This repository presents an extended-MAML approach to address the user-defined spoken term classification task. For a detailed description of the work, please refer to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10233)ã€‚

Our main contributions are:
+ We investigate the performance of MAML, as one of the most popular few-shot learning solutions, on a speech task.
+ We extend the original MAML to solve a more realistic N+M-way, K-shot problem.
+ We investigate how much a user-defined spoken term classification system can get close to a predefined one.
 
The code is based on an PyTorch implementation of MAML [MAML-PyTorch](https://github.com/dragen1860/MAML-Pytorch).
