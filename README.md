# STC-MAML-PyTorch
## A PyTorch Implementation of a Modified MAML Algorithm for Few-Shot Spoken Term Classification
This repository presents an extended-MAML approach to address the user-defined spoken term classification task. For a detailed description of the work, please refer to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10233)ã€‚

Our main contributions are:
### We investigate 

PyTorch implementation of the paper: [An Investigation of Few-Shot Learning in Spoken Term Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10233).

The code is based on an PyTorch implementation of MAML [MAML-PyTorch](https://github.com/dragen1860/MAML-Pytorch).
